	<h2> A Mobile App Developer</h2>
	<div class="description">
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>The IT industry is booming, and there are dozens of jobs available within the field: tech support, computer programmer, database analyst—the list goes on. But one of the industry’s most popular job titles today is mobile app developer, previously named Best Job in America by CNN Money. Do you have what it takes to become a mobile app developer?</p>
		<h3>Industry Outlook for Mobile App Developers</h3>
		<p>These days, it seems we’re all glued to our smartphones, constantly checking email and swiping between apps that keep us entertained or make our daily lives easier. Apps can be used for just about anything, from setting up rides or providing directions to socializing and finding dates. But it’s someone’s job to create those apps, and fortunately, the industry is booming. In fact, last year CNN Money named Mobile App Developer its Best Job in America, with a projected growth of 19 percent over the next decade, and a median salary exceeding $97,000. But that’s not all: app developers often enjoy flexible work schedules and the ability to telecommute. Plus, jobs are always in demand at software companies and tech firms, and many developers enjoy the freedom of working for themselves.</p>
		<h3>What Does It Take to Be a Mobile App Developer?</h3>
		<p>Plenty of app developers are self-taught or go through a training course, but most employers look for employees with at least a bachelor’s degree in mobile application development, software engineering, or computer science. Related fields of study, like digital design, can also set you up nicely for a lucrative application development career. <br>This formal training will provide you with the skills you need to get started in the industry, including knowledge of popular programming languages like C++, Java, SQL, and iOS, to name a few. You’ll also need to master basic programming concepts, including an understanding of the software development process and lifecycle, development methodology, and principles of stable software design. However, mobile app development is different from traditional software development, so you’ll deviate from general software development principles and learn skills specific to mobile operating systems.</p>
