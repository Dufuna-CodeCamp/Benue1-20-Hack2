Skills Descriptions

Web development:
Web development is the process of building websites and applications. It's not about the design of a website, but rather, the coding and programming that powers the website's functionality.
Web developers build and maintain websites, apps, software, and systems. Web developers can work on the frontend, the backend, or across the full technology stack.
Skills needed:
-A passion for problem-solving
-A knack for building things
-Patience, perseverance, and a desire for constant learning.
-HTML/CSS skills.
-Analytical skills.
-Responsive design skills.
-JavaScript skills.
-Interpersonal skills.
-Testing and debugging skills.
-Back-end basics.
-Search engine optimization.
Mobile app development:
Mobile Application Developers create software for mobile devices.
Mobile developers write programs inside of a mobile development environment using the Objective C, C++, C# or Java programming languages. A mobile app developer chooses the operating system (a.k.a. mobile platform) they will develop for, such as Google's Android or Apple's iOS, then learns the programming languages and software development environment for that platform.

Skills & Responsibilities:
-Mobile developers are fluent in object-oriented programming languages such as Java, Objective-C and C++.
-Mobile application developers code, test, debug, monitor and document changes for mobile applications.
-Mobile devs are skilled in the leading cross-platform development tools, such as Xamarin, Flutter & React Native.
-Mobile app developers can implement application programming interfaces (APIs) to support mobile functionality.
-Mobile application developers know the terminology, concepts, and best practices for coding mobile applications.
-Mobile application developers recommend changes and enhancements to existing mobile applications.
Data scientist:
Data Scientists analyze business data for actionable intelligence.
Data scientists mine and analyze data from a range of sources, including customer transactions, click streams, sensors, social media, log files and GPS plots. Their mission is to unlock valuable and predictive insights that will influence business decisions and spur a competitive advantage.
Skills & Responsibilities:
-Data scientists must have computer programming skills – such as SQL, Python, Unix, PHP, R and Java –
which they use to modify or develop custom analytical solutions.
-Big data scientists often use data visualizations, e.g., heat maps, to analyze and present complex trends.
-Many data scientists use Hadoop - an open-source Apache framework - to analyze & mine big data sets.
-Data scientists often work in a team setting, with managers, IT administrators, programmers, statisticians,
graphic designers, and experts in the company's products or services.
-Perform data-mining, modeling and hypothesis generation in support of high-level business goals.
-Stay current with emerging tools and techniques in machine learning, statistical modeling & analytics.
-Successful data scientists often have strong aptitudes for business, technology, mathematics & statistics.
-Need strong oral & written communication skills to present data as a concise story for diverse audiences.
-Big data scientists develop customized algorithms to solve analytical problems with incomplete data sets.
Product manager:
The product manager is responsible for defining the release process and coordinating all of the activities required to bring the product to market. This involves bridging gaps between different functions within the company and aligning all of the teams involved — namely marketing, sales, and customer support.
Skills needed:
-Communication skills
-Technical expertise
-Business skills
-Research skills
-Analytical skills
-Interpersonal skills
-Marketing skills
-Delegation skills
-Strategic thinking
-Prioritization skills
Cloud engineer:
Cloud engineers plan, develop and support organizations' rapidly growing cache of cloud computing solutions.
Skills needed:
-Technical Skills: Knowledge of HTML and computing fundamentals
-Financial skills: Awareness of financial terminologies like ROI and business concepts like online marketing strategies
-Data analysis: Expertise in data mining and handling ERP systems
-Project Management Skills: Experience in dealing with risk analytics, service agreements etc.
-Security Skills: Working knowledge of concepts related to network security, including encryptions, authorization, and protocols.
-Programming Skills:  Proficiency in programming languages is essential for scaling web applications. Languages like Php, Java, .NET are instrumental in unlocking the capabilities of the cloud. Besides these traditional languages, programming languages like Python, R and Ruby have also gained prominence in the last few years.
-Database development skills in platforms like SQL, MySQL & Hadoop.
-Have a working knowledge of emerging technologies relevant to cloud computing, e.g., Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
-Knowledge of popular operating systems such as Linux, Unix & Windows.
Machine learning engineers:
ML engineers are advanced programmers who develop artificial intelligence (AI) machines and systems that can learn and apply knowledge--are in high demand, as more companies adopt these technologies. These professionals perform sophisticated programming, and work with complex data sets and algorithms to train intelligent systems.
Skills:
-Python, Java, and R are the top languages for machine learning engineers, followed by C++, C, JavaScript, Scala, and Julia.
-Computer science fundamentals and programming: Data structures (stacks, queues, multi-dimensional arrays, trees, graphs), algorithms (searching, sorting, optimization, dynamic programming), computability and complexity (P vs. NP, NP-complete problems, big-O notation, approximate algorithms), and computer architecture (memory, cache, bandwidth, deadlocks, distributed processing).
-Probability and statistics: Formal characterization of probability (conditional probability, Bayes' rule, likelihood, independence) and techniques derived from it (Bayes Nets, Markov Decision Processes, Hidden Markov Models). Statistics measures (mean, median, variance), distributions (uniform, normal, binomial, Poisson), and analysis methods (ANOVA, hypothesis testing).
-Data modeling and evaluation: Finding patterns (correlations, clusters, eigenvectors), predicting properties of previously unseen instances (classification, regression, anomaly detection), and determining the right accuracy/error measure (e.g., log-loss for classification, or sum-of-squared-errors for regression) and an evaluation strategy (training-testing split, sequential vs. randomized cross-validation).
-Applying machine learning algorithms and libraries: Standard implementations of machine learning algorithms are available through libraries, packages, and APIs (such as scikit-learn, Theano, Spark MLlib, H2O, and TensorFlow). Applying them effectively means selecting the right model (decision tree, nearest neighbor, neural net, support vector machine, ensemble of multiple models) and a learning procedure to fit the data (linear regression, gradient descent, genetic algorithms, bagging, boosting, and other model-specific methods), as well as understanding how hyperparameters affect learning.
-Software engineering and system design: Machine engineers are typically working on software that fits into a larger ecosystem of products and services. That means they need to understand how the different parts work together, communicate with the parts (using library calls, REST APIs, and database queries), and build interfaces for your piece that others can use. This involves knowing system design and software engineering best practices (including requirements analysis, system design, modularity, version control, testing, and documentation).
